# Text Fun Translators

A collection of simple web-based tools built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This website currently includes three different text translators:

1. **Emoji Translator** ‚Äì Replace words with emojis using a custom dictionary.  
2. **Morse Code Translator** ‚Äì Convert letters and numbers into Morse code.  
3. **Weird Text Translator** ‚Äì Transform text into fun Unicode styles (Upside Down, Small Caps, Full Width).

##  Contributions and Credits

This project contains work from multiple sources. Here's a breakdown:

- **Created by Me:**  
  - **HTML structure and layout** for all three translators (`index.html`, `morse.html`, `weird.html`)  
    - Built the basic page design with headings, text areas, buttons, and output sections.  
  - **Custom CSS styling** for layout and buttons  
    - Defined fonts, colors, padding, and responsive design to make the pages look clean and user-friendly.  
    - Styled the output areas, buttons, and overall page background to match each translator‚Äôs theme.  
  - **JavaScript logic for the Weird Text Translator** (`weird.html`)  
    - Wrote the transformation functions for Upside Down, Small Caps, and Full Width text.  
    - Implemented button handling to switch between transformations instantly.  
    - Added Clear/Reset functionality for the input and output boxes.  
  - **JavaScript functions for the Emoji Translator** (`index.html`)  
    - Coded the translation process that takes user input, splits it into words/tokens, and replaces matches with emojis.  
    - Handled punctuation correctly so that words like `cat.` still translate into an emoji.  
    - Added a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`) for quick translation.  
    - Connected the translator to an external emoji dictionary JSON file.  

- **AI-Assisted:**  
  - Code snippets and logic suggestions to improve readability and maintainability  

- **External Resources / References:**  
  - Emoji dictionary file (`text_to_emoji.json`) was created from Unicode Consortium's Emoji 13.0 dataset.
